# 🔍 Suspicious File Detection Using Machine Learning  
_A Digital Forensics Mini Project_

This project uses **Machine Learning (ML)** to classify text descriptions of file behavior or system events as either **Suspicious** (malicious) or **Safe** (benign).  
It is designed for **Digital Forensics, Cybersecurity, and Malware Analysis** scenarios.
